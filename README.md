ABOUT the project 
Introducing the Lost and Found Management System â€“ a modern solution designed to transform the way we manage lost and found items. We understand the emotional and practical challenges associated with losing possessions and the desire to do the right thing when finding someone else's belongings. Our system is here to simplify and streamline this process, making it easier and more efficient for everyone involved. 

 I have uploaded all the screenshots of the project in Readme.pdf
